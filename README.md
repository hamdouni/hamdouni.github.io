Hi, it's Brahim.

I’m a software developer from planet earth with multi-cultural background and various technical skills. I consider myself as an old coder with a lot of experience.

I’m also the co-founder of Softinnov, a development shop specialized in web applications for businesses.

You’ll find here mainly posts about programming languages, operating systems and applications related to the open-source eco-system and, occasionally, my random thoughts about topics that matter to me.

Contact me on Mastodon as @codecadim, or on my email brahim ( at ) hamdouni.com.

This blog is personal and opinions here are mine.
