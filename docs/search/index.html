This article explores a common misconception about how props, variables, and component initialization work in Svelte.
The Misconception Developers new to Svelte might assume that when a prop changes, the entire component script runs again, like if the component was a function and the prop a parameter: if the prop changes, the function will give another result, right? This isn&rsquo;t how Svelte operates, and understanding this distinction is important for building functional applications.
Analyzing the Example The example demonstrates this concept with two components:
app.svelte: A parent component with buttons to select different names name.svelte: A child component that receives a name prop and tracks modifications The Parent Component (app.svelte) 1&lt;script&gt; 2 // This shows that changing the prop does not rerun the component 3 // script. 4	5 import InputName from &#34;./name.svelte&#34;; 6 let names = [&#34;John&#34;, &#34;Mila&#34;, &#34;Ali&#34;];	7 let selected = $state(); 8&lt;/script&gt; 9 10&lt;!-- This selector trigger the prop change in child component --&gt; 11{#each names as name} 12 &lt;button onclick={() =&gt; selected=name}&gt;{name}&lt;/button&gt; 13{/each} 14 15&lt;!-- This section call the child component with the prop --&gt; 16{#if selected} 17 &lt;InputName name={selected}/&gt; 18{/if} The parent component:
Maintains a list of names and a selected name state Renders buttons for each name that update the selected variable Also renders the InputName component with the selected name The Child Component (name.svelte) 1&lt;script&gt; 2 // This is a simple component that implements change detection 3	4 let { name } = $props(); 5	6 // this is executed only once at component mount 7 let original = name; 8 9 let changed = $derived(original != name); 10&lt;/script&gt; 11 12Name : &lt;input type=&#34;text&#34; bind:value={name}&gt; 13 14{#if changed} 15 modified 16{/if} The child component:
Receives a name prop using $props() Stores the initial value in an original variable Uses $derived to create a reactive changed variable that compares current and original values Displays &ldquo;modified&rdquo; when the input value differs from the original The Problem When we click on a name and start updating the field, it shows the &lsquo;modified&rsquo; indicator. This appears to work correctly.
However, when we click on another name, the indicator remains visible. We can also trigger this issue by clicking on the first name without modifying it, then clicking a second name: the &lsquo;modified&rsquo; indicator appears despite not updating anything.
The key insight is that the component&rsquo;s script block runs only once when the component is initially mounted. When props change, Svelte updates the reactive dependencies without re-running the entire script.
This means that let original = name; is executed only once during component initialization. When the name prop changes later:
The name value updates The changed derived value recalculates But the variable original still holds the first value it received The Solution To force the child component to re-execute its script when the name prop changes, we use a {#key} block in the parent component.
The {#key var} block triggers at var updates by destroying and recreating the components it surrounds.
For our example, we need to modify our code like this:
1&lt;!-- This section call the child component with the prop --&gt; 2{#if selected} 3 {#key selected} 4 &lt;InputName name={selected}/&gt; 5 {/key} 6{/if} When selected changes:
Without {#key}, the same component instance would remain and the variable original would never update With {#key}, Svelte destroys and recreates the InputName component, causing the script to run again and the variable original to be reset Conclusion Be aware of one-time initialization: Variables assigned directly in the script block are initialized only once. Use reactive declarations: Leverage $derived for values that need to react to prop changes. Understand when to use {#key}: Use it when you need to completely reset a component state, like in our example for change detection patterns. `,url:"/post/2025-03-01-svelte-component-lifecycle-reactivity/",date:"2025-03-01"},"/post/2024-12-14-tuto-svelte-dynamic-components/":{title:"Tutorial: Dynamic Svelte Components",tags:["tutorial","svelte"],content:`Svelte offers remarkable flexibility for creating dynamic components. In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll explore how to instantiate components on the fly and pass properties to them in an elegant and efficient manner.
Basics of Dynamic Components 1&lt;script&gt; 2 import Foo from &#34;./Foo.svelte&#34;; 3 import Bar from &#34;./Bar.svelte&#34;; 4 let actual = Foo; 5&lt;/script&gt; 6 7&lt;svelte:component this={actual} on:click={()=&gt;actual=Bar} /&gt; In this simple example, we import two components: Foo and Bar.
We create a variable actual where we&rsquo;ll place the current component, in this case Foo.
Svelte offers a special &lt;svelte:component&gt; tag that allows creating components on the fly.
We specify in the this property which component to display, in our example, actual.
For demonstration, we add an on:click event to change the component to Bar by simply modifying the actual variable.
Svelte takes care of displaying the component by substituting Bar for Foo.
Passing Parameters (props) A key point is the ability to pass parameters to dynamic components. For a classic component, you can write:
1&lt;Foo age=22 /&gt; We assign the value 22 to the age property.
For a dynamic component, it&rsquo;s the same:
1&lt;svelte:component this={Foo} age=22 /&gt; But let&rsquo;s imagine our second component Bar accepts 2 parameters:
1&lt;Bar age=572 name=&#34;Da Vinci&#34; /&gt; Our dynamic component should be written as:
1&lt;svelte:component this={Bar} age=572 name=&#34;Da Vinci&#34; /&gt; And there, we have a problem. How to manage them in the dynamic component while passing the right number of parameters?
My technique involves encapsulating the component with its properties in an object and using the spread operator {...props}.
For example, for the Foo component, I would write an object FooCmp:
1&lt;script&gt; 2 let FooCmp = { 3 cmp: Foo, 4 props: { 5 age: 42 6 } 7 } 8 let actual = FooCmp; 9&lt;/script&gt; 10 11&lt;svelte:component 12 this={actual.cmp} 13 {...actual.props} 14/&gt; Here&rsquo;s the complete example, using the 2 components and a flip function to interchange them.
App.svelte
1&lt;script&gt; 2 import Foo from &#34;./Foo.svelte&#34;; 3 import Bar from &#34;./Bar.svelte&#34;; 4 let FooCmp = { 5 cmp: Foo, 6 props: { 7 age: 42 8 } 9 }; 10 let BarCmp = { 11 cmp: Bar, 12 props: { 13 age: 572, 14 name: &#34;Da Vinci&#34; 15 } 16 }; 17 let actual = FooCmp; 18 let flip = () =&gt; actual = actual.cmp == Foo ? BarCmp : FooCmp; 19&lt;/script&gt; 20 21&lt;svelte:component 22 this={actual.cmp} 23 on:click={flip} 24 {...actual.props} 25/&gt; Each imported component will display its properties in a button and activate the on:click event.
Foo.svelte
1&lt;script&gt; 2 export let age = 0; 3&lt;/script&gt; 4 5&lt;button on:click&gt;Foo {age}&lt;/button&gt; Bar.svelte
1&lt;script&gt; 2 export let name = &#34;&#34;; 3 export let age = 0; 4&lt;/script&gt; 5 6&lt;button on:click&gt;Bar {name} {age}&lt;/button&gt; Note that we only pass through the on:click event as it is not processed here, but at the level of the parent, the dynamic component.
Conclusion You can easily instantiate and manipulate components on the fly with &lt;svelte:component&gt;. Svelte offers a simple and powerful approach to creating dynamic components.
And JavaScript provides us with all the tools to work around the problem of different numbers of props per component.
Don&rsquo;t hesitate to experiment and adapt this approach to your own needs!
`,url:"/post/2024-12-14-tuto-svelte-dynamic-components/",date:"2024-12-14"},"/post/2024-09-29-business-web-app/":{title:"Business web application",tags:["Business Applications","Web Apps","Small Business Solutions","Software Development","Automation"],content:`A business web application is a specialized software solution designed to help companies manage their operations effectively. Unlike generic apps such as e-commerce platforms (like Shopify) or booking management tools (like Doctolib), a business web app typically processes client-provided information, applies business-specific logic, and returns a result that helps achieve the companies goals.
Key Characteristics of a Business Web Application: Specific to Business Logic: These apps cater to the unique workflows of a business and can&rsquo;t be as generic as an e-commerce platform where similar processes are used for different domaines (buying shoes vs. laptops). Each business has its own process that needs to be mirrored in the application.
Examples: Notary services Insurance assessments Client-consultant interactions Internal and External Sides:
External: Interfaces for clients and partners to interact with the business. Internal: Tools for employees and administrators to manage operations. Some apps may focus exclusively on internal needs (e.g., Apel Fact). Ideal Candidates for Business Web Applications: Small to medium-sized businesses are typically great candidates for web applications. They have unique needs that large platforms often overlook. These businesses:
Need specialized solutions but lack the resources to invest in costly, long-term app development. Want tools that can quickly adapt to changes in their business model. Core Principles in Designing Business Web Applications: Rule #1: The App Must Adapt to the Business
The software should be tailored to the business, not the other way around. Developers must fully understand how the company operates to design a system that fits seamlessly.
Example: Apel Fact mimics Excel’s workflow because it&rsquo;s already part of the business’s natural operation. Rule #2: The App Must Evolve with the Business
As businesses evolve, so should the application. Flexibility and rapid iteration are key to ensuring the software remains relevant.
Example: RGC evolves quickly to match business needs. Development Process: Observation &amp; Research: To ensure the app fits the business, you must observe how the company operates, ask questions, and take notes. Understanding the workflows before coding is crucial.
Prototyping: Create a prototype focusing only on the core functionality — no login pages, no home screens. The aim is to demonstrate how the app will perform its main tasks.
Feedback Loop: Continuously present new versions of the prototype to the business, gathering feedback on what’s essential versus cosmetic. Focus on features that directly impact the business. Release updates with significant improvements, allowing the client to interact with the system and provide feedback.
Benefits: A well-designed business web application streamlines processes, reduces manual effort, and adapts quickly to changes, allowing businesses to focus on their core activities rather than struggling with tools that don&rsquo;t fit their needs.
In essence, a business web app enhances the way a business operates by seamlessly integrating with its processes, delivering solutions that are efficient, adaptable, and focused on business-specific logic.

When I connect all the ports, it works, but every time I switch to the Windows laptop, the screen reconfigures, my windows are moved, and it annoys me. The switch behaves as if I had physically unplugged/replugged the screen, and Windows feels compelled to adjust the entire layout!
To fix this issue, I removed the screen connection from the switch and connected both computers to the screen&rsquo;s 2 sources (HDMI 1 and 2): okay, Windows doesn&rsquo;t rearrange all my windows when I switch to it, but now I have to switch both on the switch to get my keyboard and mouse, and I also have to manually change the screen source from HDMI 1 to 2. And vice versa when I go back to my Linux!
I needed a way to switch the screen source at the same time as I switched the switch. Like, something that detects that I&rsquo;m switching and voila, changes the screen source for me.
Is that possible on Linux?
Well yes, it is.
Under Linux, we have a utility called ddcutil which allows us to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the screen and send it commands (like changing the source).
Here&rsquo;s the command to change the source:
1sudo ddcutil setvcp 60 x where x corresponds to the hexadecimal value of the source, and 60 corresponds to the source change functionality.
According to the results of ddcutil capabilities, I was supposed to use values 11 for HDMI 1, 12 for HDMI 2, and 0F for the display port.
1sudo ddcutil capabilities 2... 3 Feature: 60 (Input Source) 4 Values: 5 11: HDMI-1 6 12: HDMI-2 7 0f: DisplayPort-1 8... (I omitted other information provided by the command to focus only on the screen source)
In reality, values 11 and 12 didn&rsquo;t do anything. I tested all the x0f values and down, until I got a reaction from the screen.
And for me, it was respectively 5 and 6 for HDMI 1 and HDMI 2.
So, to switch to HDMI 1, I had to do
1sudo ddcutil setvcp 60 x5 and for HDMI 2:
1sudo ddcutil setvcp 60 x6 To prepare for the next steps, I create 2 script files with these commands.
The first one, which I name set-hdmi1.sh, is the script that changes the screen source to HDMI 1:
1#!/bin/sh 2# set input source to HDMI 1 3sudo ddcutil setvcp 60 x5 --display 2 I don&rsquo;t forget to make this script executable:
1chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/set-hdmi1.sh The second one, set-hdmi2.sh, is the script that changes the screen source to HDMI 2:
1#!/bin/sh 2# set input source to HDMI 2 3sudo ddcutil setvcp 60 x6 --display 2 And I make it executable:
1chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/set-hdmi2.sh Okay, now that it works, I need to detect the keyboard switch.
Linux allows reacting to hardware changes and launching its own actions, thanks to udev. For example, we can take action if we plug or unplug a keyboard.
For this, we need to target the right hardware, and that involves finding its identifiers. The command lsusb lists all devices connected via USB to my Linux, but I&rsquo;m only interested in keyboards, hence the filter by the grep command.
1lsusb | grep -i key 2Bus 001 Device 039: ID 04d9:0295 Holtek Semiconductor, Inc. USB-HID Keyboard The important values are right after the ID:
04d9 identifies the vendor 0295 the product Then, I create a new udev rules file, for example, 99-kvm.rules in the folder /etc/udev/rules.d with the following content:
1ACTION==&#34;remove&#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&#34;04d9&#34;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&#34;0295&#34;, RUN+=&#34;/usr/local/bin/set-hdmi2.sh&#34; 2ACTION==&#34;add&#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&#34;04d9&#34;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&#34;0295&#34;, RUN+=&#34;/usr/local/bin/set-hdmi1.sh&#34; ACTION allows me to react, either to the removal of the keyboard (action &lsquo;remove&rsquo;, I switch to HDMI 2), or to its insertion (action &lsquo;add&rsquo;, I switch to HDMI 1).
Then, I identify my hardware using the values noted above, for the attributes idVendor and idProduct.
Finally, I execute the right script.
It&rsquo;s almost done: if we want these rules to take effect immediately (rather than at the next reboot), we can run the following commands:
1sudo udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; sudo udevadm trigger And there you go! Now, I press the keyboard switch to change the screen source, and Windows stays calm! Thank you, Linux!
Note: Next time I change the KVM, I&rsquo;ll get a basic one that only handles keyboard and mouse :-)

So how can we leverage neovim to not only check for spelling but also for grammar ? And if possible, how to do it for multiple languages as I also write in French ?
We can integrate LanguageTool 1 with neovim using LTeX 2.
This is my plan
Install LTeX in neovim using Mason Apply LanguageTool suggestion using Code Actions Use Telescope for the code actions suggestion Tips : force the language in Markdown Install LTeX in neovim using Mason You can manually install LTeX in neovim with the following command
1:MasonInstall ltex-ls But, if you want to make it permanent in your configuration, or you want to change its default options, you will need to add it to your neovim init.lua. I have a special section for neovim to install and configure all my language servers in neovim. I declare an array servers :
1local servers = { 2... 3} and inside, for each language, I have this sort of snippet :
1 ltex = { 2 ltex = { 3 language = &#34;fr&#34; 4 }, 5 }, This one is for LTeX, setting the default language to French. The first key is the language server name and the second is its settings object. It is not always the same as for ltex. See, for example, the Lua version :
1 lua_ls = { 2 Lua = { 3 workspace = { checkThirdParty = false }, 4 telemetry = { enable = false }, 5 }, 6 }, Here we have lua_ls for the language server name and Lua for the object setting.
Then, I have this code to configure all servers via mason :
1-- Ensure the servers are installed 2local mason_lspconfig = require &#39;mason-lspconfig&#39; 3mason_lspconfig.setup { 4 ensure_installed = vim.tbl_keys(servers), -- take every key entry to install the corresponding language server 5} 6mason_lspconfig.setup_handlers { 7 function(server_name) 8 require(&#39;lspconfig&#39;)[server_name].setup { 9 capabilities = capabilities, 10 on_attach = on_attach, 11 settings = servers[server_name], -- associate each language server setting 12 } 13 end, 14} Apply LanguageTool suggestions So now that we have LTeX configured, how can we use it ?
As LTeX works with LSP, like any other language server, we can use the Code Actions to apply suggestions.
For example, we can use this command :
1:lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action() This brings the default neovim ui to select an action.
You better remap this to a key combination to make it more easily actionable :
1vim.keymap.set(&#39;n&#39;, &#39;&lt;leader&gt;ca&#39;, vim.lsp.buf.code_action, {desc = &#39;Code Action&#39;}, {noremap = true, silent = true}) Use Telescope as UI selector The default code actions picker of neovim is minimalist : we have to type the number associated with the action we want to apply and then press enter.
There is a nice plugin to make Telescope the default ui selector. I added this lines to my init.lua :
1 { 2 &#39;nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim&#39;, 3 config = function() require(&#34;telescope&#34;).load_extension(&#34;ui-select&#34;) end, 4 } Relaunch neovim and now, Telescope is used as a picker for the code actions.
Tips : force the language in Markdown By default, LTeX will use the default language we have configured above. But, what if you need to write a post in another language ?
An easy way is to provide LTeX with a special header in the front matter of your markdown :
1--- 2title: A nice title 3date: 2023-12-25T01:18:29+01:00 4lang: en-US 5--- The lang entry contains the language code expected by LTeX as seen in https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/supported-languages.html
LanguageTool is a multilingual spelling, style and grammar checker&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
LTeX plugs LanguageTool with editors via language server protocol (LSP)&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

The natural way to code this is using tabs.
In this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll use Svelte to code a simple application showing two tabs that can be easily extended to manage more tabs.
As usual, let&rsquo;s start a new Svelte project using Esbuild, by following my previous post Set up a Svelte project using ESBuild
You can also follow along on my GitHub page or on this Svelte Repl.
The file &ldquo;app.svelte&rdquo; will have all the logic to manage the tabs.
We will add 2 more files to showcase the tabs :
t_identity.svelte : the main tab (showed by default) t_password.svelte : another tab that will reuse our password chooser from my last post Tutorial : Password Creation in Svelte The content of these two files is not relevant for this tutorial. Our main focus will be on the app.svelte file :
1&lt;script&gt; 2	import Identity from &#34;./t_identity.svelte&#34;; 3	import Password from &#34;./t_password.svelte&#34;; 4 5	let tabs = [ 6	{ name: &#34;Identity&#34;, comp: Identity }, 7	{ name: &#34;Password&#34;, comp: Password }, 8	]; 9 10	let cur = tabs[0]; 11&lt;/script&gt; We begin the script section by importing our two tabs : Identity and Password.
Then we add them to an array tabs. We use a simple object with one field for the name and one field for storing the component. So if we want to add more tabs, we only need to import the component and add it to the array tabs.
Lastly, we declare a cur variable to store the current tab selected : by default, we&rsquo;ll use the first one in the array. So cur will contain an object with the name of tab and the component to show.
OK, that&rsquo;s all for the JavaScript part, let&rsquo;s see the HTML part :
1{#each tabs as tab} 2	&lt;button class:selected={cur === tab} on:click={() =&gt; (cur = tab)}&gt; 3	{tab.name} 4	&lt;/button&gt; 5{/each} 6 7&lt;main&gt; 8	&lt;svelte:component this={cur.comp} /&gt; 9&lt;/main&gt; We construct the tabs as buttons with a #each loop, iterating on the array tabs declared above :
class:selected={cur === tab} will affect the class selected to this button if it is the current tab (cur), so we can stylize the selected tab. on:click={() =&gt; (cur = tab)} will react to a click on the button by changing the current selected tab. {tab.name} will be the name inside the button. The important code is in the main section with the svelte:component directive.
This Svelte directive can render any component we give it. We use the fact that we stored the current tab in the cur variable, precisely, the component is in the comp field of our simple object.
So &lt;svelte:component this={cur.comp} /&gt; will render the tab at this location.
And that&rsquo;s it ! We have now a way to manage tabs with Svelte, the rest is just some CSS styling. All source code is available on GitHub.

Each time the user types anything, there is an instant validation with icons indicating which constraint is fulfilled.
I thought it was a nice way to give instant feedback to the user. But can I reproduce this behavior using Svelte ? Let&rsquo;s see !
First, let us set up a new Svelte project using esbuild. You can follow instructions in my post Set up a Svelte project using ESBuild
We&rsquo;ll start with one rule : the password length is 8 characters minimum. This way, we can &ldquo;feel&rdquo; how we can solve the problem for all the controls, setup all needed elements, without having too much in our plate. Change the app.svelte file as below :
1&lt;svelte:options customElement=&#34;app-input&#34; /&gt; 2 3&lt;script&gt; 4let pass = &#34;&#34;; 5let validLength = false; 6 7function check() { 8 validLength = (pass.length &gt;= 8); 9} 10$: check(pass); 11&lt;/script&gt; 12 13&lt;input bind:value={pass} type=&#34;password&#34;&gt; 14&lt;span class:valid={validLength}&gt; 8+ &lt;/span&gt; 15 16&lt;style&gt; 17.valid {background-color: green;} 18&lt;/style&gt; If we try this, we can see that nothing happens if we type a password until it reaches 8 characters length : then the 8+ background changes to green !
Let&rsquo;s review the code to understand what is happening here.
In the script section, we start by declaring two variables :
pass will contain the user input
validLength will indicate if the length rule is respected or not
Then, we define the check function : a straight forward validation of the password length.
The next line is more interesting. We use the $: directive to monitor any change to the password and check its validity.
1$: check(pass); So now, every time the variable pass is changed, Svelte will invoke the check function.
Below the script section, we define the HTML part by declaring the input field. It will be automatically bound to the pass variable.
1&lt;input bind:value={pass} type=&#34;password&#34;&gt; So, when the user enters characters in the input field, Svelte takes care of updating the pass variable.
In Svelte, we can also bind a CSS class to an element. Here, the span tag will be assigned the CSS class valid only if the validLengh variable is true.
1&lt;span class:valid={validLength}&gt; 8+ &lt;/span&gt; The valid class is defined in the style section : just a green background.
1.valid {background-color: green;} This is roughly all we need : the mechanism to live check the password for every keystroke and changing dynamically the style. So for the other controls, we&rsquo;ll apply the same logic.
To check if the password contains lower and upper case characters, we&rsquo;ll declare a new variable validCase :
1let validCase = false; Then we&rsquo;ll add the HTML part :
1&lt;span class:valid={validCase}&gt; a..Z &lt;/span&gt; Finally, we&rsquo;ll complete our check function to add the control :
1validCase = pass.toUpperCase() != pass &amp;&amp; pass.toLowerCase() != pass; The trick here is to compare the password to its upper and lower case versions. The control fails if it is the same as one of them.
OK, for the last control, the presence of a special character, we&rsquo;ll add this HTML :
1&lt;span class:valid={validSpecial}&gt;~&amp;#&lt;/span&gt; And we&rsquo;ll apply a regular expression in the check function :
1validSpecial = pass.replaceAll(/\\w/g, &#34;&#34;).length &gt; 0; This will remove all non-special characters and if it remains something, then there is at least one special character.
That is all, folks ! We have now a complete password creation form with live checking controls and instant feedback, with Svelte in one web component !

First, why use esbuild ? Well, it&rsquo;s a very fast bundler that&rsquo;s easy to set up, and I did not find a lot of tutorials about Svelte and esbuild.
Next, what is a custom tag ? It&rsquo;s an HTML tag, like &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;input&gt; but we are in charge to define its behavior and its look, thanks to some JavaScript code. In fact, thanks to Svelte, we can define both in a single component.
So, to do just that, in a new directory, we will create 4 files :
package.json : defines all JavaScript dependencies esbuild.js : script to launch the local server, watch files and reload Svelte index.html : our main web page app.svelte : the Svelte custom tag component package.json This is where we declare our dependencies. We need esbuild and its svelte plugin. Obviously, we also need Svelte.
1{ 2 &#34;type&#34;: &#34;module&#34;, 3 &#34;dependencies&#34;: { 4 &#34;esbuild&#34;: &#34;^0.19.4&#34;, 5 &#34;esbuild-svelte&#34;: &#34;^0.8.0&#34;, 6 &#34;svelte&#34;: &#34;^4.2.1&#34; 7 } 8} To install all of them, execute the npm install command:
1npm i If you don&rsquo;t want to create the package.json by hand, you can use this npm command :
1npm i esbuild esbuild-svelte svelte But do not forget to add the line &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;, or you&rsquo;ll get an error at build time.
File esbuild.js The esbuild script builds, watches and reloads the Svelte application.
1import * as esbuild from &#39;esbuild&#39;; 2import sveltePlugin from &#39;esbuild-svelte&#39;; 3 4let ctx = await esbuild.context({ 5	entryPoints: [&#39;app.svelte&#39;], 6	bundle: true, 7	format: &#39;esm&#39;, 8	outdir: &#39;./build&#39;, 9	plugins: [ 10	sveltePlugin({ 11	compilerOptions: { customElement: true} 12	}) 13	], 14	banner: { 15	js: &#34;new EventSource(&#39;http://127.0.0.1:8888/esbuild&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;change&#39;, () =&gt; location.reload())&#34; 16	}, 17	logLevel: &#39;info&#39; 18}); 19await ctx.watch(); 20await ctx.serve({ 21	servedir: &#39;./&#39;, 22	port: 8888, 23	host: &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; 24}); The entryPoints lists Svelte component main files : in this example, we only have app.svelte.
We want to create a custom tag (web component) so we need to force the format to esm and also activate the option customElement in the Svelte plugin.
This script will start a local server from the local directory (see servedir path) on port 8888 and watch for any changes and reload the page if any, by injecting a JavaScript code inside the rendered HTML, thanks to the banner esbuild directive.
File index.html Create an index.html file :
1&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 2&lt;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt; 3	&lt;head&gt; 4	&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; 5	&lt;meta charset=&#34;UTF-8&#34;&gt; 6	&lt;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&#34;&gt; 7	&lt;script defer src=&#34;build/app.js&#34; type=&#34;module&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 8	&lt;/head&gt; 9	&lt;body&gt; 10	&lt;app-input/&gt; 11	&lt;/body&gt; 12&lt;/html&gt; You can see that we use our web component app-input as any HTML tag. It is that easy with Svelte. Just use a two words tag with a dash separation, so the browser knows it is a custom tag.
File app.svelte And lastly, add a file &lsquo;app.svelte&rsquo; that will define our web component :
1&lt;svelte:options customElement=&#34;app-input&#34; /&gt; 2 3Hello world Now, launch your local server with :
1node esbuild.js If all is ok, you can connect your browser to http://localhost:8888/ and get the greeting message.
You can update your code and see the live refresh. Happy coding !

I want to code a simple tags input component in Svelte like the animation above.
An input text where I can type words. As soon as I type a comma or Enter, the input turns into a &ldquo;tag&rdquo;. The tag appears next to the input text with a small cross to delete it. I can retrieve the list of tags in an easy-to-use data structure: for example, an array of string.
I&rsquo;ll use the Svelte Repl for this tutorial.
Exploring possibilities In Svelte, on:keydown triggers a function on every key press. So I create a small piece of code to highlight this behavior:
1&lt;script&gt; 2function pressed(ev){ 3 console.info(ev.key); 4}; 5&lt;/script&gt; 6&lt;input on:keydown={pressed}/&gt; keydown call pressed function passing an event object as parameter. I&rsquo;m only interested in the key information inside this object as it contains the key pressed by the user.
Each press on the keyboard, with the cursor in the text field, will cause a display in the console.
So, I can monitor the input waiting for a comma by doing a test on key:
1&lt;script&gt; 2function pressed(ev){ 3 if(ev.key === &#39;,&#39;) { 4 console.info(&#34;VIRGULE!!!&#34;) 5 } 6}; 7&lt;/script&gt; 8&lt;input on:keydown={pressed}/&gt; We&rsquo;ve got something, now let&rsquo;s use that.
Into the heart of the matter When you press comma, that&rsquo;s when you have a tag to add: so I take the content of the input field and I add it to my list.
To see what I&rsquo;m doing, I add a line with &lsquo;{tags}&rsquo; which will display the list of saved tags:
1&lt;script&gt; 2let tags = []; // save tags here 3let value = &#34;&#34;; // input value 4function pressed(ev){ 5 if(ev.key === &#39;,&#39;) { // comma ? 6 tags = [...tags, value]; // add to the list 7 value = &#34;&#34;; // and clean input 8 } 9}; 10&lt;/script&gt; 11{tags} 12&lt;input on:keydown={pressed} bind:value/&gt; Small problem: the comma remains in the field despite the cleaning.
The keydown intercepts the event before the key is taken into account by the input field. So our processing is fired before the comma is added in the value variable.
Instead of keydown, we will rather use keyup, which will trigger our function after input is taken care. So the comma will be embedded in the value of the field.
1&lt;script&gt; 2let tags = []; 3let value = &#34;&#34;; 4function pressed(ev){ 5 if(ev.key === &#39;,&#39;) { 6 tags = [...tags, value]; 7 value = &#34;&#34;; 8 } 9}; 10&lt;/script&gt; 11{tags} 12&lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; &lt;!-- keyup instead of keydown --&gt; Now the comma no longer stays in the field, but is part of the &lsquo;value&rsquo;.
I can easily remove it before adding to the list:
1value = value.replace(&#39;,&#39;,&#39;&#39;); So now my code looks like :
1&lt;script&gt; 2let tags = []; 3let value = &#34;&#34;; 4function pressed(ev){ 5 if(ev.key === &#39;,&#39;) { 6 value = value.replace(&#39;,&#39;,&#39;&#39;); // &lt;-- here we remove comma 7 tags = [...tags, value]; 8 value = &#34;&#34;; 9 } 10}; 11&lt;/script&gt; 12{tags} 13&lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; Before continuing, I make sure that the user does not enter anything wrong in the field. For example, a single comma or the Enter key with no value should have no effect, which is not the case with the current code.
So, once I remove the comma, if I have nothing left, it means I have nothing to do:
1&lt;script&gt; 2let tags = []; 3let value = &#34;&#34;; 4function pressed(ev){ 5 if(ev.key === &#39;,&#39;) { 6 value = value.replace(&#39;,&#39;,&#39;&#39;); 7 if(value !== &#34;&#34;) { // &lt;-- not empty ? 8 tags = [...tags, value]; // &lt;-- let&#39;s work... 9 value = &#34;&#34;; 10 } 11 } 12}; 13&lt;/script&gt; 14{tags} 15&lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; I don&rsquo;t like this multi-nested level. I rather reverse the tests and exit immediately if the conditions are not met. Thus, I end up with the &ldquo;good code&rdquo; aligned to the left.
Demonstration:
1&lt;script&gt; 2let tags = []; 3let value = &#34;&#34;; 4function pressed(ev){ 5 if(ev.key !== &#39;,&#39;) return; 6 value = value.replace(&#39;,&#39;,&#39;&#39;); 7 if(value === &#34;&#34;) return; 8 tags = [...tags, value]; 9 value = &#34;&#34;; 10}; 11&lt;/script&gt; 12{tags} 13&lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; Oh, I forgot I wanted to use also Enter as a tag separator :
1&lt;script&gt; 2let tags = []; 3let value = &#34;&#34;; 4function pressed(ev){ 5 if(ev.key !== &#39;,&#39; &amp;&amp; ev.key !== &#39;Enter&#39;) return; // &lt;-- Enter too 6 value = value.replace(&#39;,&#39;,&#39;&#39;); 7 tags = [...tags, value]; 8 value = &#34;&#34;; 9}; 10&lt;/script&gt; 11{tags} 12&lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; Time to take care of the visualization of the tags : I iterate on every saved tags with the #each command:
1{#each tags as t,i} 2... 3{/each} #each takes every item inside the tags array and makes it available in the t variable with its index in i.
Let&rsquo;s use this to display each tag with an X next to it. The X is used to remove the tag.
It&rsquo;s not a real X, it&rsquo;s an utf8 code that looks way more stylish 😎.
1{#each tags as t,i} 2 {t} ⨉ 3{/each} Ok, the X is not actionable yet, so I add an anchor around it with a call to a del function with the index of the tag to remove.
1{#each tags as t,i} 2 {t} &lt;a href=&#34;#del&#34; on:click={()=&gt;del(i)}&gt;⨉&lt;/a&gt; 3{/each} The del function just calls Splice.
1function del(idx){ 2 tags.splice(idx,1); // &lt;-- remove the element at index \`idx\` 3 tags = tags; // &lt;-- force Svelte reactivity 4} The line with tags = tags is used to force Svelte to refresh. This is one of the rare cases where I need to explicitly indicate to Svelte that de data model has changed.
I surround each tag with a &lsquo;span&rsquo; element and add a little touch of CSS to make it look more taggy:
1{#each tags as t,i} 2 &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt; 3 {t} &lt;a href=&#34;#del&#34; on:click={()=&gt;del(i)}&gt;⨉&lt;/a&gt; 4 &lt;/span&gt; 5{/each} 6&lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; 7 8&lt;style&gt; 9.tag {font-size: 0.8rem; margin-right:0.33rem; padding:0.15rem 0.25rem; border-radius:1rem; background-color: #5AD; color: white;} 10.tag a {text-decoration: none; color: inherit;} 11&lt;/style&gt; Icing on the cake: suggestions! It will be nice if I can have suggestions as I type the first characters.
HTML let us the possibility to add suggestions in an input field, from a predefined list: datalist contains the suggestions list, and we use it with the list property inside the input field.
I define a new tagsugg variable with all my suggestions:
1let tagsugg = [&#34;tag1&#34;, &#34;tag2&#34;, &#34;tag3&#34;]; In a real project, this list can be generated from all previously saved tags in the system.
From this list, I construct the HTML datalist:
1&lt;datalist id=&#34;tag_suggestion&#34;&gt; 2 {#each tagsugg as ts} 3 &lt;option&gt;{ts}&lt;/option&gt; 4 {/each} 5&lt;/datalist&gt; Then I can reference it inside the input field with the list property:
1&lt;input list=&#34;tag_suggestion&#34; on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/&gt; That&rsquo;s it (for the moment) !
I now have an input text field that generates tags with a suggestion list !
A very useful evolution is to transform this code to a web component, so it can be used like an HTML tag (no pun intended 😎).

I knew Go didn&rsquo;t have an inheritance mechanism. But, was that enough to disqualify it as an object language ?
Allow me to share with you my thoughts on the subject.
But first, what is an object language ? Wikipedia defines an object as a representation of a concept, idea, or entity in the physical world1, with properties and behaviors.
For example, we could represent a car by its brand, color and fuel. That would represent its properties.
For its behavior, we can say that a car can start, accelerate and brake.
In the same entity, we find data to store the states (properties), and functions or methods to interact with the object (behavior).
So, the definition of an object language would be a language that allows data and functions to be grouped together in the same structure?
Not so simple because with the arrival of new languages, or the evolution of some, this definition has evolved. Today, we can define an object language according to the following criteria :
Encapsulation: the object has a state (data) and a behavior (methods). We are clearly in the definition of the object seen above.
Abstraction: the object can &ldquo;hide&rdquo; its internal functioning and expose an interface allowing other objects to interact with it.
Inheritance: the object can adopt the behavior of another object without it being necessary to redefine this behavior.
Polymorphism: either the same behavior changes according to the object to which it applies, or an inherited behavior is redefined.
Does Go tick all the boxes of an object language ? Encapsulation A struct is a collection of data in Go. Here is how I will define a new type &lsquo;Point&rsquo; as a composite object containing its position:
1type Point struct { 2	X, Y float64 3} It is possible to define methods on types thanks to the receiver. We add the type that receives the method before the name of the method. For example :
1func (p Point) Dist() float64 { 2	return math.Sqrt(p.X*p.X + p.Y*p.Y) 3} The ingredients for encapsulation are all there: a way to bundle data and behaviors.
Abstraction Data visibility from the outside2 is defined by the case of the variable name: lower case for a private variable and upper case for a public variable. For example :
1type Car struct { 2 Color string // accessible from outside 3 code string // not accessible from outside 4} The same principle is applied for methods which, if their name begins with a lowercase letter, cannot be used externally. Conversely, if their name begins with a capital letter, they will be visible.
Go calls this mechanism the export of names and allows functionality to be hidden or exposed, as defined by the abstraction.
Inheritance I said above that I knew Go had no inheritance. But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that Go doesn&rsquo;t achieve the same thing as inheritance. Indeed, Go allows type embedding.
For example, let&rsquo;s take the example of the car and define a &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; object with a &ldquo;Move&rdquo; method:
1type Car struct { 2 Name string 3} 4func (v Vehicle) Move() { 5 println(&#34;I move&#34;) 6} Anything that makes up a vehicle can be incorporated into a &ldquo;Car&rdquo; object as follows:
1type Car struct { 2 Vehicle 3} What if we had to use all of this:
1var tuture Car 2 3tuture.Vehicle.Move() // &#34;I move&#34; 4tuture.Move() // &#34;I move&#34; Complete example on the playground
The two calls to the &ldquo;Move&rdquo; method are valid and there is a way to inherit behaviors from one object to another.
Polymorphism In the previous example, the 2 calls to the &ldquo;Move&rdquo; method gave the same result because they called the same &ldquo;Move&rdquo; method defined at the level of the &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; object. We can redefine the method at the &ldquo;Car&rdquo; level as follows:
1func (v Car) Move() { 2 println(&#34;I move like a car&#34;) 3} Therefore, calls to &ldquo;Move&rdquo; would give different results:
1var tuture Car 2 3tuture.Vehicle.Move() // &#34;I move&#34; 4tuture.Move() // &#34;I move like a car&#34; A method inherited from a parent object can therefore be modified at the child object level.
But we can go further. Go has the notion of interface which allows us to define types by their behavior. Concretely, an interface is a collection of methods.
1type Vehicle interface { 2 Move() 3} 4 5type Car struct {} 6func (v Car) Move() { 7 println(&#34;I move like a car&#34;) 8} 9 10type Bus struct {} 11func (c Bus) Move() { 12 println(&#34;I move like a bus&#34;) 13} 14 15func Check(v Vehicle) { 16 v.Move() 17} We could then call &ldquo;Check&rdquo; either with a &ldquo;Car&rdquo; type or a &ldquo;Bus&rdquo; type as in the following example:
1var tuture Car 2var minibus Bus 3 4Check(tuture) // &#34;I move like a car&#34; 5Check(minibus) // &#34;I move like a bus&#34; Complete example on the playground
With the redefinition of inherited methods and interfaces, Go implements polymorphism at several levels.
Conclusion Go is indeed an object language. So what ?
What matters much more than ticking the boxes of this or that paradigm is giving coders all needed tools to do their job as well as possible. The designers of Go took from other languages what seemed to them the most relevant to make the code readable, efficient and maintainable.
In my opinion, Go remains an extremely productive language in my daily life as a developer.

The answer is obviously yes (otherwise I will not write this post) thanks to a pure Go implementation of Sqlite3.
So here is a quick introduction to this package !
How to install it? By adding a line in the import bloc :
1import( 2... 3_ &#34;modernc.org/sqlite&#34; 4... 5) Don&rsquo;t forget to run a go mod tidy to start solving the dependencies and automatically download the package.
How to use it ? Sqlite can store its data in a file, therefore we need to specify such file :
1... 2db, err := sql.Open(&#34;sqlite&#34;, &#34;/tmp/testbase.db&#34;) 3... How to request it? Exactly like with another db, using the sql package. For instance, for a simple query that returns rows of results:
1rows, err := db.Query(&#34;SELECT * FROM userinfo&#34;) That&rsquo;s it !
This package is a good way to embed a database cheaply in its program while keeping the SQL paradigm.

This time, I&rsquo;ll try to make a MySQL client and server communicate through a Nebula tunnel. And to make it a little bit more difficult, I&rsquo;ll use podman to run the client and the server in containers.
I begin by restarting the virtual machines :
1vagrant up To restart Nebula automatically, I&rsquo;m using systemd. I generate the config file for Nebula service :
1cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; nebula.service 2echo 3[Unit] 4Description=Nebula service 5[Service] 6Type=simple 7ExecStart=/opt/nebula/nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml 8Restart=on-failure 9[Install] 10WantedBy=multi-user.target 11EOF Then I push this file in the boxA temporary folder. I wish I could place it directly at his place at /etc/systemd/system but, to do that, I would need more privilege :
1vagrant upload nebula.service /tmp/ boxA Now, inside boxA, I can &ldquo;sudo&rdquo; to place the config file in the apropriate folder :
1vagrant ssh boxA -c &#34;sudo mv /tmp/nebula.service /etc/systemd/system/&#34; And, I activate this service so it starts at boot time.
1vagrant ssh boxA -c &#34;sudo systemctl enable nebula&#34; I do the same for boxB, beginning by copying the config file :
1vagrant upload nebula.service /tmp/ boxB Then I move it to the right place :
1vagrant ssh boxB -c &#34;sudo mv /tmp/nebula.service /etc/systemd/system/&#34; Finaly I activate the service :
1vagrant ssh boxB -c &#34;sudo systemctl enable nebula&#34; Now, it is Podman turn to be installed, first on boxA :
1vagrant ssh boxA -c &#34;sudo apt install -y podman &amp;&amp; sudo reboot&#34; Then on boxB :
1vagrant ssh boxB -c &#34;sudo apt install -y podman &amp;&amp; sudo reboot&#34; Just after Podman installation, I need to reboot the virtual machines, so podman can be launched as rootless (in the user session).
And because I configured Nebula as a systemd service, the tunnel will start as well.
I just need to wait that the 2 virtual machines finish to boot. I can see their status with vagrant status :
1&gt; vagrant status 2 3Current machine states: 4 5boxA running (virtualbox) 6boxB running (virtualbox) I install the MySQL image and start the server onboxA :
1vagrant ssh boxA -c &#34;podman run -p 192.168.168.100:3306:3306 --name=db --env MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=&#39;true&#39; -dt docker.io/library/mysql&#34; podman run : I use Podman without sudo (it&rsquo;s one big advantage on Docker) to start the container with MySQL.
-p 192.168.168.100:3306:3306 : I publish the MySQL port on the Nebula IP so I can access the server from another machine on this network.
&ndash;name=db : I name this container db so I can easily manipulate it later.
&ndash;env MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=&lsquo;true&rsquo; : I choose an empty password for this test. Of course, I would not do that in production.
-dt docker.io/library/mysql&quot;: at last I specify the MySQL image to use.
To check if the server is correctly started, I can use podman ps :
1&gt; vagrant ssh boxA -c &#34;podman ps&#34; 2 3CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 4d6c2625aafb4 docker.io/library/mysql mysqld 30 seconds ago Up 30 seconds ago 192.168.168.100:3306-&gt;3306/tcp db It is working !
So now, I try to access this server from boxB. I use nearly the same podman command as before, but this time I run the MySQL client :
If all is ok I will be prompted by MySQL :
1&gt; vagrant ssh boxB -c &#34;podman run -ti --rm docker.io/library/mysql mysql -h192.168.168.100 -uroot&#34; 2Welcome to the MySQL monitor.

And if possible something easier to install and configure than OpenVpn ?
A few months ago, I heard about Nebula from Defined and wanted to test it : one single binary, some certificates and as secure as it can be, that sounded promising !
So here we are trying to simulate a mesh network between 2 virtual machines using Vagrant on my Ubuntu Linux distribution 20.04 with Virtualbox already installed.
Vagrant Vagrant from Hashicorp is the tool I use to manage virtual machines.
1sudo apt install -y vagrant I configure Vagrant to have 2 virtual machines with Debian 11, named respectively boxA and boxB.
To make it simple, I use my host network interface to link the 2 virtual machines (so eth0 in my case) and use the available DHCP of my local network.
1cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; Vagrantfile 2Vagrant.configure(&#34;2&#34;) do |config| 3 config.vm.define &#34;boxA&#34; do |boxA| 4 boxA.vm.box = &#34;generic/debian11&#34; 5 boxA.vm.network &#34;public_network&#34;, bridge: &#34;eth0&#34; 6 end 7 config.vm.define &#34;boxB&#34; do |boxB| 8 boxB.vm.box = &#34;generic/debian11&#34; 9 boxB.vm.network &#34;public_network&#34;, bridge: &#34;eth0&#34; 10 end 11end 12EOF Now I can launch the 2 machines with a single command :
1vagrant up Nebula Installing nebula is as simple as downloading the binaries from github. I choose nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz to comply to my configuration.
1wget https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases/download/v1.6.0/nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz After downloading, I uncompress the archive :
tar xf nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz I now have 2 binaries : nebula and nebula-cert.
nebula will be copied on the 2 virtual machines. This is the main binary who will establish the bridge between the machines. nebula-cert will be used to generate all needed certificates : 1./nebula-cert ca -name &#34;ACME, Inc&#34; 2./nebula-cert sign -name &#34;boxA&#34; -ip &#34;192.168.168.100/24&#34; 3./nebula-cert sign -name &#34;boxB&#34; -ip &#34;192.168.168.200/24&#34; I choose 192.168.168.* as my mesh network IP addresses : .100 for boxA and .200 for boxB.
The results of the commands are this list of files :
1ca.crt 2ca.key 3boxA.crt 4boxA.key 5boxB.crt 6boxB.key To make it more simple to copy the files to the virtual machines, I create a folder per machine and copy the needed files :
1mkdir boxA boxB 2mv boxA.* boxA &amp;&amp; mv boxB.* boxB Now I want to generate a Nebula configuration file, that will be common for the 2 machines. I need to get their IP addresses on my local network (those assigned by my DHCP server). I know that vagrant will use the eth1 interface inside the machines, so I use some magic shell script :
First on boxA :
1boxAip=$(vagrant ssh boxA --no-tty -c &#34;ip address show eth1| grep &#39;inet &#39; | sed -e &#39;s/^.*inet //&#39; -e &#39;s/\\/.*$//&#39;&#34; | tr -d &#39;\\r&#39;) Then on boxB :
1boxBip=$(vagrant ssh boxB --no-tty -c &#34;ip address show eth1| grep &#39;inet &#39; | sed -e &#39;s/^.*inet //&#39; -e &#39;s/\\/.*$//&#39;&#34; | tr -d &#39;\\r&#39;) The magic is that $boxAip and $boxBip variables now contain the wanted IPs. Let use them inside the Nebula config in the static_host_map section :
1cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; config.yml 2pki: 3 ca: /etc/nebula/ca.crt 4 cert: /etc/nebula/host.crt 5 key: /etc/nebula/host.key 6static_host_map: 7 &#34;192.168.168.100&#34;: [&#34;$boxAip:4242&#34;] 8 &#34;192.168.168.200&#34;: [&#34;$boxBip:4242&#34;] 9lighthouse: 10 am_lighthouse: false 11listen: 12 host: 0.0.0.0 13 port: 4242 14punchy: 15 punch: true 16tun: 17 disabled: false 18 dev: nebula1 19 drop_local_broadcast: false 20 drop_multicast: false 21 tx_queue: 500 22 mtu: 1300 23 routes: 24 unsafe_routes: 25logging: 26 level: info 27 format: text 28firewall: 29 conntrack: 30 tcp_timeout: 12m 31 udp_timeout: 3m 32 default_timeout: 10m 33 max_connections: 100000 34 outbound: 35 - port: any 36 proto: any 37 host: any 38 inbound: 39 - port: any 40 proto: any 41 host: any 42EOF It&rsquo;s time to configure the machines. First, let send all the files to each machine :
1vagrant upload ./boxA /tmp/ boxA 2vagrant upload ./boxB /tmp/ boxB 3vagrant upload ca.crt /tmp/ boxA 4vagrant upload ca.crt /tmp/ boxB 5vagrant upload config.yml /tmp/ boxA 6vagrant upload config.yml /tmp/ boxB 7vagrant upload nebula /tmp/ boxA 8vagrant upload nebula /tmp/ boxB Now I ssh in each machine and continue the configuration :
First, boxA :
1vagrant ssh boxA Inside boxA, I move the files in their respective location and finally launch Nebula in the background before quitting boxA :
1sudo mkdir /etc/nebula 2sudo mv /tmp/config.yml /etc/nebula/config.yml 3sudo mv /tmp/ca.crt /etc/nebula/ca.crt 4sudo mv /tmp/boxA.crt /etc/nebula/host.crt 5sudo mv /tmp/boxA.key /etc/nebula/host.key 6sudo mkdir /opt/nebula 7sudo mv /tmp/nebula /opt/nebula/ 8chmod +x /opt/nebula/nebula 9cd /opt/nebula 10sudo ./nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml &amp; 11exit Let&rsquo;s configure boxB,
1vagrant ssh boxB Then I move all files and launch Nebula :
1sudo mkdir /etc/nebula 2sudo mv /tmp/config.yml /etc/nebula/config.yml 3sudo mv /tmp/ca.crt /etc/nebula/ca.crt 4sudo mv /tmp/boxB.crt /etc/nebula/host.crt 5sudo mv /tmp/boxB.key /etc/nebula/host.key 6sudo mkdir /opt/nebula 7sudo mv /tmp/nebula /opt/nebula/ 8chmod +x /opt/nebula/nebula 9cd /opt/nebula 10sudo ./nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml &amp; 11exit Ok, at this moment, I have 2 virtual machines, with a Nebula network between them. How am I going to verify that it is really working ?
Well if I can ping boxB from boxA, it will mean that all is ok, so let&rsquo;s found out :
1vagrant ssh boxA -c &#34;ping 192.168.168.200&#34; Hourra ! It is working. Of course, I can do it on the other side :
1vagrant ssh boxB -c &#34;ping 192.168.168.100&#34; And that&rsquo;s all folks for part 1 !
Next, I&rsquo;ll try to use this configuration to execute a MySQL server on one machine, and access it from a MySQL client on the other machine. And to make it a little more difficult, I&rsquo;ll use Podman as the container engine to execute this client and server.

This tip did not work for me.
So let&rsquo;s try to debug it.
First, we close the auto-completion server (see github.com/nsf/gocode ) :
1gocode close 2killall gocode Then we relaunch it as a server in debug mode inside a console :
1gocode -debug -s So now, we can see what&rsquo;s happening.
OK, time to try an auto-completion inside VS Code.
Bingo ! We got some useful log :

Weird, my GOROOT isn&rsquo;t at /usr/local/go but at /usr/lib/go.
It seems like gocode doesn&rsquo;t care about my env and arbitrary choose to look inside this folder.
Ok, let&rsquo;s trick him with a symlink :
1sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go /usr/local/go Now it works !

To reduce docker container size we can built the image from scratch instead of using bloated images, like debian or worse ubuntu.
But to put a golang binary in it you have to take care of some important stuff. We&rsquo;ll see briefly how to do it. For more details, see Building Minimal Docker Containers For Go Applications
Compile staticaly your go program :
1CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o server Your Dockerfile looks like this :
1FROM scratch 2ADD static /static 3ADD server /server 4CMD /server But if you add some upload code in your program, this won&rsquo;t work. The upload needs the tmp folder for big files that are sent in multipart form.
Below, the code in the os.file_unix Go package :
1// TempDir returns the default directory to use for temporary files. 2func TempDir() string { 3	dir := Getenv(&#34;TMPDIR&#34;) 4	if dir == &#34;&#34; { 5	if runtime.GOOS == &#34;android&#34; { 6	dir = &#34;/data/local/tmp&#34; 7	} else { 8	dir = &#34;/tmp&#34; 9	} 10	} 11	return dir 12} So, as we are on linux, dir = &ldquo;/tmp&rdquo; is our usual suspect.
But the scratch docker does not contain a tmp folder. This was a hard bug to catch but so easy to fix, just changing the Docker file :
1FROM scratch 2VOLUME /tmp 3ADD static /static 4ADD server /server Now link the container /tmp to the host tmp :
1docker run -P -v /tmp:/tmp your_image That&rsquo;s it ! Enjoy a fully functionnal minimal docker golang application !

mysldump --master-data -l -q yourbase &gt; backup.sql This will add all information needed on the slave side : just stop the slave before restoring the dump, and restart it after.

We define the &lsquo;home&rsquo; and &lsquo;work&rsquo; networks as usual with the iface command. The 2 differences are :
we use the virtual interface &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;home&rdquo; instead of the real interface &ldquo;wlan0&rdquo;. we add a test line that checks the ssid : this is used by guessnet to guess the right network The mapping block uses an external script (here guessnet) with prudent parameters
the &lsquo;map home work&rsquo; tells guessnet to only check this 2 networks the init-time wait a little before configuring, to let the drive enough time That&rsquo;s it !

They can&rsquo;t make all their clients move to the newest browsers. But some times, it can drive you nuts to achieve simple things. Our problem was about a background image in a div that doesn&rsquo;t want to strech. Just some css will do it for all other browsers, but not for IE8. It needs a special &ldquo;filter&rdquo; like this :\n1.logondesktop { filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader( enabled=true, src=&#39;http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/&#39;, sizingMethod=&#39;scale&#39;);} _ More info on this filter at Microsoft _\nHere we add a nice background (thanks to Lorem Pixel ) to the &rsquo;logondesktop&rsquo; element. Ok, that made the trick. But, wait ?!? What happen to my links and form input inside the div ? There are no more clickable !!!\nDamned IE8, another bug&hellip; Now, dig again to find a fix. Hopefully, it was easy. The div content must be relatively positioned. So the html looks like\n1&lt;div class=&#34;logondesktop&#34;&gt; 2 &lt;div class=&#34;logon&#34;&gt; 3 &lt;a href=&#34;#&#34;&gt;CLICK ME IF YOU DARE!&lt;/a&gt; 4 &lt;/div&gt; 5&lt;/div&gt; 6```sh 7And the css to fix the IE8 bug : 8 9```css 10.logon { position: relative; } See an example here (open with IE8) : http://fiddle.jshell.net/hamdouni/w4BBE/show\n",url:"/post/2014-07-17-stretched-background-with-ie8/",date:"2014-07-17"},"/post/2014-06-30-speech-tasks-une-webapp-avec-reconnaissance-vocale/":{title:"Speech Tasks : a voice driven todo webapp",tags:["go","Javascript"],content:`With the Go http server.

It&rsquo;s fast, flexible and fun. My linux desktop is up and running after a few seconds&hellip; (ok, thanks also to the ssd :-) ).
But, after I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04, I&rsquo;ve lost the ability to mount my usb disks with the file manager (same problem with Nautilus or Thunar). I&rsquo;m getting this frustrating &ldquo;not authorized&rdquo; message.
My work around was to &lsquo;pmount&rsquo; the disk. It works but I need to search for the right device before, with dmesg, then provide the right syntax. Not so fun.
After digging a while, I found out that authorizations are managed with policykit. So after reading man page after man page, posts after posts, I found a way to easily mount my usb disks in my file manager.
Just edit a new policykit config file :
1sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/55-myconf.pkla The number and the .pkla extension are mandatory to respect. The name &lsquo;myconf&rsquo; is as you will.
Inside this file, insert those lines :
[Dealing with disks] Identity=unix-group:plugdev Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount;org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media;org.freedesktop.ud$ ResultAny=yes ResultInactive=yes ResultActive=yes Now, we have to restart DBUS as it&rsquo;s the service that launch the polkitd daemon
1sudo restart dbus If you launch, as I do, gnome-settings-daemon manually, you need to relaunch it after dbus
1gnome-settings-daemon -r &amp; That&rsquo;s it ! Plug an usb drive and use your file manager to browse it. No more &rsquo;not authorized&rsquo; message !

So you want to put a nice video as background of your site but don&rsquo;t know how to do ? &ldquo;Fear you must not&rdquo; said Yoda as it&rsquo;s really simple.
First, have a look at the effect in action . Nice, isn&rsquo;t it ?
First thing first, the html :
1&lt;video src=&#34;your-video.mp4&#34;&gt;&lt;/video&lt; 2&lt;div&gt; your fantastic text here &lt;/div&gt; Now, the css magic :
1video { 2 z-index: -999; 3 position: fixed; 4 min-height: 100%; 5 min-width: 100%; 6} The z-index indicates that the video layer is in the background. Everything with a higher index will appear above.
The position fixed is mandatory, to make sure the overlay plays well.
Finally, ensure that the video dimension takes all space available, with the min height and width tags to 100%.
If you would like to have your text centered horizontally and vertically, just add this css :
1html, body { width: 100%; height: 100%; } 2body {display:table;} 3div {display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;} And that&rsquo;s all !
This method works on all major browser : I tested it on Firefox, Chrome and Safari. It also works unmodified on IE9 !

2048 : a very famous game where you have to slide the numbered tiles to join same numbers, and cumulate them to obtain 2048 !
Now, do you know Marmelab to brute force test web application : it&rsquo;s like releasing on your app thousand gremlins clicking every where, typing non-sense input on keyboard, so they may detect breaches in your app.
Ok, so I mixed the two of them, and I get 2048Gremlins ! It&rsquo;s like letting the gremlins play 2048 !
Disclaimer !
quick and dirty code here. I just wanted to show it&rsquo;s possible :-) only for Firefox : sorry for webkits engine (chrome, safari, &hellip;) but keyboard simulation does only work in Firefox (until someone points me to the solution for webkit :-) ) Gremlins are bad at 2048 :-) random isn&rsquo;t a good strategy to access high scores :-) It was fun to hack those wonderfull projects and it made me learn more things about gremlins.js.

Since I didn’t have a tape recorder to save my programs, I had to type them in again every time I wanted to play.
Luckily, the ZX81 only had 1 kB of memory, so the programs were small : about 20 lines of BASIC filled the RAM.
The limited memory also forced me to think creatively. After learning BASIC, I explored Z80 machine language and began using commands like PEEK and POKE.
From then on, I kept coding on different machines like the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Sun Sparc, and IBM RS/6000, and learned new languages along the way like GFA BASIC, 68000 Assembler, Turbo Pascal, C, Java, and others.
In the mid-90s, after getting a degree in computer science, I started working in the early Internet days when Mosaic was the main browser, and Netscape was just coming onto the scene. My work involved building B2B services for the web, first using CGI with Perl, and later with Java servlets.
In 2002, after working in a few different companies, I decided to co-found Softinnov, a small business focused on developing web applications.
I’m still here, working on online services.
Most of what I share here is about programming languages, operating systems, and open-source software, along with the occasional post about things I find interesting.
