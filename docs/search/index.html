It\u0026rsquo;s fast, flexible and fun. My linux desktop is up and running after a few seconds\u0026hellip; (ok, thanks also to the ssd :-) ).\nBut, after I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost the ability to mount my usb disks with the file manager (same problem with Nautilus or Thunar). I\u0026rsquo;m getting this frustrating \u0026ldquo;not authorized\u0026rdquo; message.\nMy work around was to \u0026lsquo;pmount\u0026rsquo; the disk. It works but I need to search for the right device before, with dmesg, then provide the right syntax. Not so fun.\nAfter digging a while, I found out that authorizations are managed with policykit. So after reading man page after man page, posts after posts, I found a way to easily mount my usb disks in my file manager.\nJust edit a new policykit config file :\nsudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/55-myconf.pkla The number and the .pkla extension are mandatory to respect. The name \u0026lsquo;myconf\u0026rsquo; is as you will.\nInside this file, insert those lines :\n[Dealing with disks] Identity=unix-group:plugdev Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount;org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media;org.freedesktop.ud$ ResultAny=yes ResultInactive=yes ResultActive=yes Now, we have to restart DBUS as it\u0026rsquo;s the service that launch the polkitd daemon\nsudo restart dbus If you launch, as I do, gnome-settings-daemon manually, you need to relaunch it after dbus\ngnome-settings-daemon -r \u0026amp; That\u0026rsquo;s it ! Plug an usb drive and use your file manager to browse it. No more \u0026rsquo;not authorized\u0026rsquo; message !\n",url:"/post/2014-06-18-usb-disk-et-policykit/",date:"2014-06-18"},"\/post\/2014-05-26-earth-viewed-from-iss-zen-moment\/":{title:"Earth viewed from ISS -  Zen moment...",tags:["space","zen"],content:"src = NASA\n",url:"/post/2014-05-26-earth-viewed-from-iss-zen-moment/",date:"2014-05-26"},"\/post\/2014-05-06-video-background\/":{title:"Video background",tags:["background","css","css3","html","HTML5","video"],content:" Forget large background image for your web site. Now, comes video time.\n So you want to put a nice video as background of your site but don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do ? \u0026ldquo;Fear you must not\u0026rdquo; said Yoda as it\u0026rsquo;s really simple.\nFirst, have a look at the effect in action . Nice, isn\u0026rsquo;t it ?\nFirst thing first, the html :\n\u0026lt;video src=\u0026#34;your-video.mp4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/video\u0026lt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; your fantastic text here \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Now, the css magic :\nvideo {  z-index: -999;  position: fixed;  min-height: 100%;  min-width: 100%; } The z-index indicates that the video layer is in the background. Everything with a higher index will appear above.\nThe position fixed is mandatory, to make sure the overlay plays well.\nFinally, ensure that the video dimension takes all space available, with the min height and width tags to 100%.\nIf you would like to have your text centered horizontally and vertically, just add this css :\nhtml, body { width: 100%; height: 100%; } body {display:table;} div {display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;} And that\u0026rsquo;s all !\nThis method works on all major browser : I tested it on Firefox, Chrome and Safari. It also works unmodified on IE9 !\n",url:"/post/2014-05-06-video-background/",date:"2014-05-06"},"\/post\/2014-04-28-2048-gremlins\/":{title:"2048 Gremlins",tags:["Javascript","web"],content:"2048 : a very famous game where you have to slide the numbered tiles to join same numbers, and cumulate them to obtain 2048 !\nNow, do you know Marmelab to brute force test web application : it\u0026rsquo;s like releasing on your app thousand gremlins clicking every where, typing non-sense input on keyboard, so they may detect breaches in your app.\nOk, so I mixed the two of them, and I get 2048Gremlins !
