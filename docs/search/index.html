I want to code a simple tags input component in Svelte like the animation above.
An input text where I can type words. As soon as I type a comma or Enter, the input turns into a \u0026ldquo;tag\u0026rdquo;. The tag appears next to the input text with a small cross to delete it. I can retrieve the list of tags in an easy-to-use data structure: for example, an array of string.
I\u0026rsquo;ll use the Svelte Repl for this tutorial.
Exploring possibilities In Svelte, on:keydown triggers a function on every keypress. So I create a small piece of code to highlight this behavior:
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function pressed(ev){ console.info(ev.key); }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input on:keydown={pressed}/\u0026gt; keydown call pressed function passing an event object as parameter. I\u0026rsquo;m only interested in the key information inside this object as it contains the key pressed by the user.
Each press on the keyboard, with the cursor in the text field, will cause a display in the console.
So, I can monitor the input waiting for a comma by doing a test on key:
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key === ',') { console.info(\u0026quot;VIRGULE!!!\u0026quot;) } }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input on:keydown={key}/\u0026gt; We\u0026rsquo;ve got something, now let\u0026rsquo;s use that.
Into the heart of the matter When you press comma, that\u0026rsquo;s when you have a tag to add: so I take the content of the input field and I add it to my list.
To see what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, I add a line with \u0026lsquo;{tags}\u0026rsquo; which will display the list of saved tags:
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; let tags = []; // save tags here let value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; // input value function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key === ',') { // comma ? tags = [...tags, value]; // add to the list value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; // and clean input } }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {tags} \u0026lt;input on:keydown={key} bind:value/\u0026gt; Small problem: the comma remains in the field despite the cleaning.
The keydown intercepts the event before the key is taken into account by the input field. So our processing is fired before the comma is added in the value variable.
Instead of keydown, we will rather use keyup, which will trigger our function after input is taken care. So the comma will be embeded in the value of the field.
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; let tags = []; let value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key === ',') { tags = [...tags, value]; value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; } }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {tags} \u0026lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; // \u0026lt;-- keyup instead of keydown Now the comma no longer stays in the field, but is part of the \u0026lsquo;value\u0026rsquo;.
I can easily remove it before adding to the list:
value = value.replace(',',''); So now my code looks like :
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; let tags = []; let value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key === ',') { value = value.replace(',',''); // \u0026lt;-- here we remove comma tags = [...tags, value]; value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; } }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {tags} \u0026lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; Before continuing, I make sure that the user does not enter anything wrong in the field. For example, a single comma or an Enter with no value should have no effect, which is not the case with the current code.
So, once I remove the comma, if I have nothing left, it means I have nothing to do:
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; let tags = []; let value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key === ',') { value = value.replace(',',''); if(value !== \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) { // \u0026lt;-- not empty ? tags = [...tags, value]; // \u0026lt;-- let's work... value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; } } }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {tags} \u0026lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; I don\u0026rsquo;t like this multi-nested level. I rather reverse the tests and exit immediately if the conditions are not met. Thus, I end up with the \u0026ldquo;good code\u0026rdquo; aligned to the left.
Demonstration:
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; let tags = []; let value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key !== ',') return; value = value.replace(',',''); if(value === \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) return; tags = [...tags, value]; value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {tags} \u0026lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; Oh, I forgot I wanted to use also Enter as a tag separator :
\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; let tags = []; let value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; function pressed(ev){ if(ev.key !== ',' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ev.key !== 'Enter') return; // \u0026lt;-- Enter too value = value.replace(',',''); tags = [...tags, value]; value = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {tags} \u0026lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; Time to take care of the tags visualisation : I iterate on every saved tags with the #each command:
{#each tags as t,i} ... {/each} #each takes every item inside the tags array and makes it available in the t variable with its index in i.
Let\u0026rsquo;s use this to display each tag with an X next to it. The X is used to remove the tag.
It\u0026rsquo;s not a real X, it\u0026rsquo;s an utf8 code that looks way more stylish 😎.
{#each tags as t,i} {t} ⨉ {/each} Ok, the X is not activable yet, so I add an anchor around it with a call to a del function with the index of the tag to remove.
{#each tags as t,i} {t} \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;#del\u0026quot; on:click={()=\u0026gt;del(i)}\u0026gt;⨉\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; {/each} The del function just call Splice.
function del(idx){ tags.splice(idx,1); // \u0026lt;-- supprime un élément en idx tags = tags; // \u0026lt;-- force la réactivité de Svelte } The line with tags = tags is used to force Svelte to refresh (this is one of the rare cases where I need to explicitly indicate to Svelte that de data model has changed).
I surround each tag with a \u0026lsquo;span\u0026rsquo; element and add a little touch of css to make it look more taggy:
{#each tags as t,i} \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {t} \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;#del\u0026quot; on:click={()=\u0026gt;del(i)}\u0026gt;⨉\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {/each} \u0026lt;input on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; .tag {font-size: 0.8rem; margin-right:0.33rem; padding:0.15rem 0.25rem; border-radius:1rem; background-color: #5AD; color: white;} .tag a {text-decoration: none; color: inherit;} \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; Icing on the cake: suggestions! It will be nice if I can have suggestions as I type the first characters.
HTML let us the possibility to add suggestions in a input field, from a predefined list: datalist contains the suggestions list and we use it with the list property inside the input field.
I define a new tagsugg variable with all my suggestions:
let tagsugg = [\u0026quot;tag1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tag2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tag3\u0026quot;]; In a real project, this list can be generated from all previously saved tags in the system.
From this list, I construct the HTML datalist:
\u0026lt;datalist id=\u0026quot;tag_suggestion\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {#each tagsugg as ts} \u0026lt;option\u0026gt;{ts}\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; {/each} \u0026lt;/datalist\u0026gt; Then I can reference it inside the input field with the list property:
\u0026lt;input list=\u0026quot;tag_suggestion\u0026quot; on:keyup={pressed} bind:value/\u0026gt; That\u0026rsquo;s it (for the moment) !
I now have an input text field that generates tags with a suggestion list !
A very usefull evolution is to transform this code to a web component so it can be used like a HTML tag (no pun intended 😎).

I knew Go didn\u0026rsquo;t have an inheritance mechanism. But, was that enough to disqualify it as an object language ?
Allow me to share with you my thoughts on the subject.
But first of all, what is an object language ? Wikipedia defines an object as a representation of a concept, idea, or entity in the physical world1, with properties and behaviors.
For example, we could represent a car by its brand, color and fuel. That would represents its properties.
For its behavior, we can say that a car can start, accelerate and brake.
In the same entity, we find data to store the states (properties), and functions or methods to interact with the object (behavior).
So, the definition of an object language would be a language that allows data and functions to be grouped together in the same structure?
Not so simple because with the arrival of new languages, or the evolution of some, this definition has evolved. Today, we can define an object language according to the following criteria :
encapsulation: the object has a state (data) and a behavior (methods). We are clearly in the definition of the object seen above.
abstraction: the object can \u0026ldquo;hide\u0026rdquo; its internal functioning and expose an interface allowing other objects to interact with it.
inheritance: the object can adopt the behavior of another object without it being necessary to redefine this behavior.
polymorphism: either the same behavior changes according to the object to which it applies, or an inherited behavior is redefined.
Does Go tick all the boxes of an object language ? Encapsulation A struct is a collection of data in Go. Here is how I will define a new type \u0026lsquo;Point\u0026rsquo; as a composite object containing its position:
type Point struct { X, Y float64 } It is possible to define methods on types thanks to the receiver. We add the type that receives the method before the name of the method. For example :
func (p Point) Dist() float64 { return math.Sqrt(p.X*p.X + p.Y*p.Y) } The ingredients for encapsulation are all there: a way to bundle data and behaviors.
Abstraction Data visibility from the outside2 is defined by the case of the variable name: lower case for a private variable and upper case for a public variable. For example :
type Car struct { Color string // accessible from outside code string // not accessible from outside } The same principle is applied for methods which, if their name begins with a lowercase letter, cannot be used externally. Conversely, if their name begins with a capital letter, they will be visible.
Go calls this mechanism the export of names and allows functionality to be hidden or exposed, as defined by the abstraction.
Inheritance I said above that I knew Go had no inheritance. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that Go doesn\u0026rsquo;t achieve the same thing as inheritance. Indeed, Go allows type embedding.
For example, let\u0026rsquo;s take the example of the car and define a \u0026ldquo;Vehicule\u0026rdquo; object with a \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; method:
type Car struct { Name string } func (v Vehicule) Move() { println(\u0026#34;I move\u0026#34;) } Anything that makes up a vehicule can be incorporated into a \u0026ldquo;Car\u0026rdquo; object as follows:
type Car struct { Vehicule } What if we had to use all of this:
var tuture Car tuture.Vehicule.Move() // \u0026#34;I move\u0026#34; tuture.Move() // \u0026#34;I move\u0026#34; Complete example on the playground
The two calls to the \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; method are valid and there is a way to inherit behaviors from one object to another.
Polymorphism In the previous example, the 2 calls to the \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; method gave the same result because they called the same \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; method defined at the level of the \u0026ldquo;Vehicule\u0026rdquo; object. We can redefine the method at the \u0026ldquo;Car\u0026rdquo; level as follows:
func (v Car) Move() { println(\u0026#34;I move like a car\u0026#34;) } Therefore, calls to \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; would give different results:
var tuture Car tuture.Vehicule.Move() // \u0026#34;I move\u0026#34; tuture.Move() // \u0026#34;I move like a car\u0026#34; A method inherited from a parent object can therefore be modified at the child object level.
But we can go further. Go has the notion of interface which allows to define new types by their behavior. Concretely, an interface is a collection of methods.
type Vehicule interface { Move() } type Car struct {} func (v Car) Move() { println(\u0026#34;I move like a car\u0026#34;) } type Bus struct {} func (c Bus) Move() { println(\u0026#34;I move like a bus\u0026#34;) } func Check(v Vehicule) { v.Move() } We could then call \u0026ldquo;Check\u0026rdquo; either with a \u0026ldquo;Car\u0026rdquo; type or a \u0026ldquo;Bus\u0026rdquo; type as in the following example:
var tuture Car var minibus Bus Check(tuture) // \u0026#34;I move like a car\u0026#34; Check(minibus) // \u0026#34;I move like a bus\u0026#34; Complete example on the playground
With the redefinition of inherited methods and interfaces, Go implements polymorphism at several levels.
Conclusion Go is indeed an object language. So what ?
What matters much more than ticking the boxes of this or that paradigm is giving coders all needed tools to do their job as well as possible. The designers of Go took from other languages what seemed to them the most relevant to make the code readable, efficient and maintainable.
In my opinion, Go remains an extremely productive language in my daily life as a developer.

Even better, can this database be queried in SQL? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to learn another way to query data.
The answer is obviously yes (otherwise I will not write this post) thanks to a pure Go implementation of Sqlite3.
So here is a quick introduction to this package !
How to install it? By adding a line in the import bloc :
import( ... _ \u0026#34;modernc.org/sqlite\u0026#34; ... ) Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to run a go mod tidy to start solving the dependencies and automatically download the package.
How to use it ? Sqlite can store its data in a file, therefore we need to specify such file :
... db, err := sql.Open(\u0026#34;sqlite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/tmp/testbase.db\u0026#34;) ... How to request it? Exactly like with another db, using the sql package. For instance, for a simple query that returns rows of results:

This time, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to make a MySQL client and server communicate through a Nebula tunnel. And to make it a little bit more difficult, I\u0026rsquo;ll use podman to run the client and the server in containers.
I begin by restarting the virtual machines :
vagrant up To restart Nebula automatically, I\u0026rsquo;m using systemd. I generate the config file for Nebula service :
cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; nebula.service echo [Unit] Description=Nebula service [Service] Type=simple ExecStart=/opt/nebula/nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml Restart=on-failure [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF Then I push this file in the boxA temporary folder.

And because I configured Nebula as a systemd service, the tunnel will start as well.
I just need to wait that the 2 virtual machines finish to boot. I can see their status with vagrant status :
\u0026gt; vagrant status Current machine states: boxA running (virtualbox) boxB running (virtualbox) I install the MySQL image and start the server onboxA :
vagrant ssh boxA -c \u0026#34;podman run -p 192.168.168.100:3306:3306 --name=db --env MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=\u0026#39;true\u0026#39; -dt docker.io/library/mysql\u0026#34; podman run : I use Podman without sudo (it\u0026rsquo;s one big advantage on Docker) to start the container with MySQL.
-p 192.168.168.100:3306:3306 : I publish the MySQL port on the Nebula IP so I can access the server from another machine on this network.
\u0026ndash;name=db : I name this container db so I can easily manipulate it later.
\u0026ndash;env MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=\u0026lsquo;true\u0026rsquo; : I choose an empty password for this test. Of course, I would not do that in production.
-dt docker.io/library/mysql\u0026quot;: at last I specify the MySQL image to use.
To check if the server is correctly started, I can use podman ps :
\u0026gt; vagrant ssh boxA -c \u0026#34;podman ps\u0026#34; CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES d6c2625aafb4 docker.io/library/mysql mysqld 30 seconds ago Up 30 seconds ago 192.168.168.100:3306-\u0026gt;3306/tcp db It is working !
So now, I try to access this server from boxB. I use nearly the same podman command as before, but this time I run the MySQL client :
If all is ok I will be prompted by MySQL :
\u0026gt; vagrant ssh boxB -c \u0026#34;podman run -ti --rm docker.io/library/mysql mysql -h192.168.168.100 -uroot\u0026#34; Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g.

And if possible something easier to install and configure than OpenVpn ?
A few months ago, I heard about Nebula from Defined and wanted to test it : one single binary, some certificates and as secure as it can be, that sounded promising !
So here we are trying to simulate a mesh network between 2 virtual machines using Vagrant on my Ubuntu Linux distribution 20.04 with Virtualbox already installed.
Vagrant Vagrant from Hashicorp is the tool I use to manage virtual machines.
sudo apt install -y vagrant I configure Vagrant to have 2 virtual machines with Debian 11, named respectively boxA and boxB.
To make it simple, I use my host network interface to link the 2 virtual machines (so eth0 in my case) and use the available DHCP of my local network.
cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; Vagrantfile Vagrant.configure(\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;) do |config| config.vm.define \u0026#34;boxA\u0026#34; do |boxA| boxA.vm.box = \u0026#34;generic/debian11\u0026#34; boxA.vm.network \u0026#34;public_network\u0026#34;, bridge: \u0026#34;eth0\u0026#34; end config.vm.define \u0026#34;boxB\u0026#34; do |boxB| boxB.vm.box = \u0026#34;generic/debian11\u0026#34; boxB.vm.network \u0026#34;public_network\u0026#34;, bridge: \u0026#34;eth0\u0026#34; end end EOF Now I can launch the 2 machines with a single command :
vagrant up Nebula Installing nebula is as simple as downloading the binaries from github. I choose nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz to comply to my configuration.
wget https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases/download/v1.6.0/nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz After downloading, I uncompress the archive :
tar xf nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz I now have 2 binaries : nebula and nebula-cert.
nebula will be copied on the 2 virtual machines. This is the main binary who will establish the bridge between the machines. nebula-cert will be used to generate all needed certificates : ./nebula-cert ca -name \u0026#34;ACME, Inc\u0026#34; ./nebula-cert sign -name \u0026#34;boxA\u0026#34; -ip \u0026#34;192.168.168.100/24\u0026#34; ./nebula-cert sign -name \u0026#34;boxB\u0026#34; -ip \u0026#34;192.168.168.200/24\u0026#34; I choose 192.168.168.* as my mesh network IP addresses : .100 for boxA and .200 for boxB.
The results of the commands are this list of files :
ca.crt ca.key boxA.crt boxA.key boxB.crt boxB.key To make it more simple to copy the files to the virtual machines, I create a folder per machine and copy the needed files :
mkdir boxA boxB mv boxA.* boxA \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mv boxB.* boxB Now I want to generate a Nebula configuration file, that will be common for the 2 machines. I need to get their IP addresses on my local network (those assigned by my DHCP server). I know that vagrant will use the eth1 interface inside the machines, so I use some magic shell script :
First on boxA :
boxAip=\$(vagrant ssh boxA --no-tty -c \u0026#34;ip address show eth1| grep \u0026#39;inet \u0026#39; | sed -e \u0026#39;s/^.*inet //\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/\\/.*\$//\u0026#39;\u0026#34; | tr -d \u0026#39;\\r\u0026#39;) Then on boxB :
boxBip=\$(vagrant ssh boxB --no-tty -c \u0026#34;ip address show eth1| grep \u0026#39;inet \u0026#39; | sed -e \u0026#39;s/^.*inet //\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/\\/.*\$//\u0026#39;\u0026#34; | tr -d \u0026#39;\\r\u0026#39;) The magic is that \$boxAip and \$boxBip variables now contain the wanted IPs. Let use them inside the Nebula config in the static_host_map section :
cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; config.yml pki: ca: /etc/nebula/ca.crt cert: /etc/nebula/host.crt key: /etc/nebula/host.key static_host_map: \u0026#34;192.168.168.100\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;\$boxAip:4242\u0026#34;] \u0026#34;192.168.168.200\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;\$boxBip:4242\u0026#34;] lighthouse: am_lighthouse: false listen: host: 0.0.0.0 port: 4242 punchy: punch: true tun: disabled: false dev: nebula1 drop_local_broadcast: false drop_multicast: false tx_queue: 500 mtu: 1300 routes: unsafe_routes: logging: level: info format: text firewall: conntrack: tcp_timeout: 12m udp_timeout: 3m default_timeout: 10m max_connections: 100000 outbound: - port: any proto: any host: any inbound: - port: any proto: any host: any EOF It\u0026rsquo;s time to configure the machines. First, let send all the files to each machine :
vagrant upload ./boxA /tmp/ boxA vagrant upload ./boxB /tmp/ boxB vagrant upload ca.crt /tmp/ boxA vagrant upload ca.crt /tmp/ boxB vagrant upload config.yml /tmp/ boxA vagrant upload config.yml /tmp/ boxB vagrant upload nebula /tmp/ boxA vagrant upload nebula /tmp/ boxB Now I ssh in each machine and continue the configuration :
First, boxA :
vagrant ssh boxA Inside boxA, I move the files in their respective location and finally launch Nebula in the background before quitting boxA :
sudo mkdir /etc/nebula sudo mv /tmp/config.yml /etc/nebula/config.yml sudo mv /tmp/ca.crt /etc/nebula/ca.crt sudo mv /tmp/boxA.crt /etc/nebula/host.crt sudo mv /tmp/boxA.key /etc/nebula/host.key sudo mkdir /opt/nebula sudo mv /tmp/nebula /opt/nebula/ chmod +x /opt/nebula/nebula cd /opt/nebula sudo ./nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml \u0026amp; exit Let\u0026rsquo;s configure boxB,
vagrant ssh boxB Then I move all files and launch Nebula :
sudo mkdir /etc/nebula sudo mv /tmp/config.yml /etc/nebula/config.yml sudo mv /tmp/ca.crt /etc/nebula/ca.crt sudo mv /tmp/boxB.crt /etc/nebula/host.crt sudo mv /tmp/boxB.key /etc/nebula/host.key sudo mkdir /opt/nebula sudo mv /tmp/nebula /opt/nebula/ chmod +x /opt/nebula/nebula cd /opt/nebula sudo ./nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml \u0026amp; exit Ok, at this moment, I have 2 virtual machines, with a Nebula network between them. How am I going to verify that it is really working ?
Well if I can ping boxB from boxA, it will mean that all is ok, so let\u0026rsquo;s found out :
vagrant ssh boxA -c \u0026#34;ping 192.168.168.200\u0026#34; Hourra ! It is working. Of course, I can do it on the other side :
vagrant ssh boxB -c \u0026#34;ping 192.168.168.100\u0026#34; And that\u0026rsquo;s all folks for part 1 !
Next, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to use this configuration to execute a MySQL server on one machine, and access it from a MySQL client on the other machine. And to make it a little more difficult, I\u0026rsquo;ll use Podman as the container engine to execute this client and server.

So let\u0026rsquo;s try to debug it.
First, we close the auto-completion server (see github.com/nsf/gocode ) :
gocode close killall gocode Then we relaunch it as a server in debug mode inside a console :
gocode -debug -s So now, we can see what\u0026rsquo;s happening.
OK, time to try an auto-completion inside VS Code.
Bingo ! We got some useful log :

Weird, my GOROOT isn\u0026rsquo;t at /usr/local/go but at /usr/lib/go.
It seems like gocode doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about my env and arbitrary choose to look inside this folder.
Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s trick him with a symlink :
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go /usr/local/go Now it works !

To reduce docker container size we can built the image from scratch instead of using bloated images, like debian or worse ubuntu.
But to put a golang binary in it you have to take care of some important stuff. We\u0026rsquo;ll see briefly how to do it. For more details, see Building Minimal Docker Containers For Go Applications
Compile staticaly your go program :
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o server Your Dockerfile looks like this :
FROM scratch ADD static /static ADD server /server CMD /server But if you add some upload code in your program, this won\u0026rsquo;t work. The upload needs the tmp folder for big files that are sent in multipart form.
Below, the code in the os.file_unix Go package :
// TempDir returns the default directory to use for temporary files. func TempDir() string { dir := Getenv(\u0026#34;TMPDIR\u0026#34;) if dir == \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { if runtime.GOOS == \u0026#34;android\u0026#34; { dir = \u0026#34;/data/local/tmp\u0026#34; } else { dir = \u0026#34;/tmp\u0026#34; } } return dir } So, as we are on linux, dir = \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; is our usual suspect.
But the scratch docker does not contain a tmp folder. This was a hard bug to catch but so easy to fix, just changing the Docker file :
FROM scratch VOLUME /tmp ADD static /static ADD server /server Now link the container /tmp to the host tmp :
docker run -P -v /tmp:/tmp your_image That\u0026rsquo;s it ! Enjoy a fully functionnal minimal docker golang application !

I tried to resync a slave MySQL after it disconnected from the master. But the binary log was already deleted on master, so the only solution was to restore from the last backup. To avoid lock tables on the master and remember the binary log name and position to put them on the slave configuration, there is a tip to take care of all that : the \u0026ldquo;- master-data\u0026rdquo; option in mysqldump.
mysldump --master-data -l -q yourbase \u0026gt; backup.sql This will add all information needed on the slave side : just stop the slave before restoring the dump, and restart it after.

We define the \u0026lsquo;home\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;work\u0026rsquo; networks as usual with the iface command. The 2 differences are :
we use the virtual interface \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; instead of the real interface \u0026ldquo;wlan0\u0026rdquo;. we add a test line that checks the ssid : this is used by guessnet to guess the right network The mapping block uses an external script (here guessnet) with prudent parameters
the \u0026lsquo;map home work\u0026rsquo; tells guessnet to only check this 2 networks the init-time wait a little before configuring, to let the drive enough time That\u0026rsquo;s it !

They can\u0026rsquo;t make all their clients move to the newest browsers. But some times, it can drive you nuts to achieve simple things. Our problem was about a background image in a div that doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to strech. Just some css will do it for all other browsers, but not for IE8. It needs a special \u0026ldquo;filter\u0026rdquo; like this :\n.logondesktop { filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader( enabled=true, src=\u0026#39;http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/\u0026#39;, sizingMethod=\u0026#39;scale\u0026#39;);} _ More info on this filter at Microsoft _\nHere we add a nice background (thanks to Lorem Pixel ) to the \u0026rsquo;logondesktop\u0026rsquo; element.

It\u0026rsquo;s fast, flexible and fun. My linux desktop is up and running after a few seconds\u0026hellip; (ok, thanks also to the ssd :-) ).
But, after I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost the ability to mount my usb disks with the file manager (same problem with Nautilus or Thunar). I\u0026rsquo;m getting this frustrating \u0026ldquo;not authorized\u0026rdquo; message.
My work around was to \u0026lsquo;pmount\u0026rsquo; the disk. It works but I need to search for the right device before, with dmesg, then provide the right syntax. Not so fun.
After digging a while, I found out that authorizations are managed with policykit. So after reading man page after man page, posts after posts, I found a way to easily mount my usb disks in my file manager.
Just edit a new policykit config file :
sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/55-myconf.pkla The number and the .pkla extension are mandatory to respect. The name \u0026lsquo;myconf\u0026rsquo; is as you will.
Inside this file, insert those lines :
[Dealing with disks] Identity=unix-group:plugdev Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount;org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media;org.freedesktop.ud\$ ResultAny=yes ResultInactive=yes ResultActive=yes Now, we have to restart DBUS as it\u0026rsquo;s the service that launch the polkitd daemon
sudo restart dbus If you launch, as I do, gnome-settings-daemon manually, you need to relaunch it after dbus
gnome-settings-daemon -r \u0026amp; That\u0026rsquo;s it ! Plug an usb drive and use your file manager to browse it. No more \u0026rsquo;not authorized\u0026rsquo; message !

So you want to put a nice video as background of your site but don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do ? \u0026ldquo;Fear you must not\u0026rdquo; said Yoda as it\u0026rsquo;s really simple.
First, have a look at the effect in action . Nice, isn\u0026rsquo;t it ?
First thing first, the html :
\u0026lt;video src=\u0026#34;your-video.mp4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/video\u0026lt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; your fantastic text here \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Now, the css magic :
video { z-index: -999; position: fixed; min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; } The z-index indicates that the video layer is in the background. Everything with a higher index will appear above.
The position fixed is mandatory, to make sure the overlay plays well.
Finally, ensure that the video dimension takes all space available, with the min height and width tags to 100%.
If you would like to have your text centered horizontally and vertically, just add this css :
html, body { width: 100%; height: 100%; } body {display:table;} div {display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;} And that\u0026rsquo;s all !
This method works on all major browser : I tested it on Firefox, Chrome and Safari. It also works unmodified on IE9 !

2048 : a very famous game where you have to slide the numbered tiles to join same numbers, and cumulate them to obtain 2048 !
Now, do you know Marmelab to brute force test web application : it\u0026rsquo;s like releasing on your app thousand gremlins clicking every where, typing non-sense input on keyboard, so they may detect breaches in your app.
Ok, so I mixed the two of them, and I get 2048Gremlins ! It\u0026rsquo;s like letting the gremlins play 2048 !
Disclaimer !
quick and dirty code here. I just wanted to show it\u0026rsquo;s possible :-) only for Firefox : sorry for webkits engine (chrome, safari, \u0026hellip;) but keyboard simulation does only work in Firefox (until someone points me to the solution for webkit :-) ) Gremlins are bad at 2048 :-) random isn\u0026rsquo;t a good strategy to access high scores :-) It was fun to hack those wonderfull projects and it made me learn more things about gremlins.js.

I did not have a tape recorder to save my programs, so each time I wanted to play a game, I had to type it !
Hopefully, the ZX81 had only 1 kB so the programs were small : RAM was full with 20 lines of BASIC.
The other good effect of having only 1 kB was that you are forced to be creative to solve problems. So after Basic, I taught myself the Z80 machine language and the glorious PEEK and POKE commands.
Since then, I never stopped to code on various machines (Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Sun Sparc, IBM RS/6000\u0026hellip;) and with fabulous languages (GFA Basic, 68000 Assembler, Turbo Pascal, C, Java, \u0026hellip;).
After an university computer science degree in the middle of the 90\u0026rsquo;s, I began working in the early Internet : Mosaïc was the king of the browser and Netscape the new kid on the block. My job was to code B2B services on the web with CGI (common gateway interfaces) using Perl, then Java servlet. Old good time !
Fast forward to 2002, after a few companies, big or small, startups, incubator, it comes the time I needed to have my own business adventure, so I co-founded Softinnov, a development shop specialized in web applications for businesses.
And I\u0026rsquo;m still there developing online services !
