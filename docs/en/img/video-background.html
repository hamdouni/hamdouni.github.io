		<h1>Highway to Heaven !!!!! </h1>
		<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/HighwaytoHeaven2.jpg">The series stars Michael Landon as Jonathan Smith, an angel sent down to earth "on probation", and his human companion Mark Gordon, played by Victor French, Landon's co-star from Little House on the Prairie. Jonathan and Mark are given "assignments" by "The Boss" (God) where they are required to use their humanity (and sometimes a little bit of "The Stuff") to help various troubled souls overcome their problems. These problems include families dealing with sick loved ones; "all-around losers" who are encouraged to find their self-worth; people coping with loss of family such as war widows; wealthy and greedy businessmen being encouraged to use their wealth for good; charlatans who used religion and civil rights for personal gain; and discouraging prejudice in regard to people of different ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and disabilities. While dealing sensitively with these situations, the show also uses humor, particularly between Jonathan and Mark.
