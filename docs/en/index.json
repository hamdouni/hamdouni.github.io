For more details, see Building Minimal Docker Containers For Go Applications\nCompile staticaly your go program :\nCGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o server Your Dockerfile looks like this :\nFROM scratch ADD static /static ADD server /server CMD /server  But if you add some upload code in your program, this won\u0026#8217;t work.

They can\u0026#8217;t make all their clients move to the newest browsers. But some times, it can drive you nuts to achieve simple things. Our problem was about a background image in a div that doesn\u0026#8217;t want to strech. Just some css will do it for all other browsers, but not for IE8. It needs a special \u0026#8220;filter\u0026#8221; like this :\n.logondesktop { filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader( enabled=true, src='http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/', sizingMethod='scale');}  _More info on this filter at Microsoft_\nHere we add a nice background (thanks to Lorem Pixel) to the \u0026#8216;logondesktop\u0026#8217; element. Ok, that made the trick. But, wait ?!? What happen to my links and form input inside the div ? There are no more clickable !!!\nDamned IE8, another bug\u0026#8230; Now, dig again to find a fix. Hopefully, it was easy. The div content must be relatively positioned. So the html looks like\n\u0026lt;div class=\"logondesktop\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\"logon\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\"#\"\u0026gt;CLICK ME IF YOU DARE!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  And the css to fix the IE8 bug :\n.logon { position: relative; }  See an example here (open with IE8) : http://fiddle.jshell.net/hamdouni/w4BBE/show\n"

The name \u0026#8216;myconf\u0026#8217; is as you will.\nInside this file, insert those lines :\n [Dealing with disks]\nIdentity=unix-group:plugdev\nAction=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount;org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject-media;org.freedesktop.ud$\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes\n Now, we have to restart DBUS as it\u0026#8217;s the service that launch the polkitd daemon\n sudo restart dbus\n If you launch, as I do, gnome-settings-daemon manually, you need to relaunch it after dbus\n gnome-settings-daemon -r \u0026amp;\n That\u0026#8217;s it !
