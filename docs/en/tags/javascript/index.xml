      <description>A few months ago, I read an article about brain training by learning a new language : very interesting story about William Alexander who failed to learn french but strenghten his brain trying to.
But this is not the subject of this post. As I finished to read the article, I tried to reach William Alexander&amp;#8217;s website and was redirected to a crappy chineese online store.

      <description>With the Web Speech Api, some good javascript libs and several lines of code, you can easily add speech recognition in your web application. All is done thanks to AnnYang JS lib made by Tal Ater, plumbing with Angular Light by Oleg Nechaev and served by a Go http server. (By the way, I love opensource community !)
Try the demo ! See the code ! And thanks to Mark McGranaghan for his tutorial to deploy go app on Heroku</description>

      <description>Do you know Gabriele Cirulli ? He is the 2048 game creator : a very famous game where you have to slide the numbered tiles to join same numbers, and cumulate them to obtain 2048 !
Now, do you know Gremlins.js ? A Javascript library made by Marmelab to brute force test web application : it&amp;#8217;s like releasing on your app thousand gremlins clicking every where, typing non-sense input on keyboard, so they may detect breaches in your app.</description>
